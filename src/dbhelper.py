# get_player_season_list(player_id, token) -> list[season_id]
#     # From funcHelper: hits API (or cached data) to return all seasons where this player has stats; drives the season loop.

# get_player_season_row(player_id, season_id, token) -> (team_id, row)
#     # From funcHelper: for a single (player_id, season_id) gets raw API data, extracts team_id + ordered stats list matching PLAYER_SEASON_INSERT.
