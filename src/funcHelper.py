# build_player_season_stats_url(player_id, season_id=None, resource=None, include=None, filters=None) -> str (url)
    # Builds the SportMonks API URL for a player's season stats; default include=statistics.details.type; used by all season-stat calls.

# get_player_season_row(player_id, season_id, token) -> (team_id: int, row: list)
#     # Calls API for one (player_id, season_id), parses JSON into team_id + ordered stats list matching PLAYER_SEASON_INSERT (minus player_id).

# get_player_season_row_detail(player_id, season_id, token) -> dict (data)
#     # Debug helper: returns the full raw JSON for a single (player_id, season_id) request without flattening into a stats row.

# build_url(base, resource, token, include=None, filters=None) -> str (url)
#     # Low-level URL builder used by build_player_season_stats_url; attaches api_token, include, and filters query parameters.

# build_season_stat_list(player_id, season_list, token) -> list[(team_id, row)]
#     # For one player_id and a list of season_ids: loops seasons, calls get_player_season_row for each, and collects all (team_id, row) pairs.

# build_season_list(data) -> list[season_id]
#     # Given raw JSON response containing statistics[]: extracts all season_id values into a flat Python list.

# get_player_season_list(player_id, token) -> list[season_id]
#     # High-level season discovery: calls API once (no season filter), then uses build_season_list to return all seasons where this player has stats.
