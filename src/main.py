#get_player_season_row                      - Given Season_id, player_id, token                     ->  returns player/Season row of statistics
#build_season_list                          - Given Response Body of player-season                  ->  returns list of seasons    
#Has_values                                 - Given Response Body looks for has_value               ->  returns boolean of has_value
#build_season_stat_list                     - Given player_id, season_list                          -> returns 2D list of statistics per player_season
