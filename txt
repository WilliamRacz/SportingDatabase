# Robotics Python Review
#------------------------------------------------

'''
1.  Create a string containing the phrase "what's up!"
    Create a list containing the numbers 3, 18, 29, 9, 44
'''
message = "whats up!"
lst = [3,18,29,9,44]
'''
2. Print the first and last character of your string on the same line.
    Subtract 1 from the 3rd number and print the middle 3 numbers of your list.
    You should see [18, 28, 9]
'''

message = message[1:-1]
print(message)
lst[3]=lst[3] - 1



'''
3. Check if the first letter of your string is p and if it is print 'yes!' otherwise print 'no!'
    Check if the third entry of the list is even and if it is print 'yes!' otherwise print 'no!'
'''
if message(1) == 'p':
    print("yes!")
else:
    print("no!")

if lst[3] % 2 == 0:
    print("yes!")
else:
    print("no!")
    
'''
4. Loop through all numbers in your list and print them all out. 
'''
for num in lst:
    print(num)

'''
5. Loop through the numbers in your list and print out just the even numbers.
'''
for num in lst:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)


'''
6. Loop through the numbers in your list and print out just the indices of the even numbers.
'''
for x in range(len(lst)):
    if lst[x] % 2 == 0 :
        print(x)
    
'''
7. Use an input and ask the user for a number, if it is positive, print 'positive!'
    otherwise print 'negative!'
'''

userInt = int(input(print("Give me a number g: ")))
if userInt > 0:
    print("I'm Positive !")


'''
8. Use an input and a loop to ask the user for a number and keep asking until they input a
    positive number. For example the terminal should look something like:
    Enter a positive number: -2
    Not a positive number
    Enter a positive number: -18
    Not a positive number
    Enter a positive number: 1
    Thank you
'''
while(True):
    num = int(input("Give me a random number"))
    if num % 2 == 0 :
        break
    print("Didn't see to work :(")





'''
9. Write a function that takes a list as a parameter and returns the number of 
    even number elements in the list.
    For example: the list [1, 18, 22, 31] entered in the function would output 2
    Call the function twice using the list [1, 2, 3, 4] and [18, 22, -3, 6] and 
    print the result.
'''


'''
10. Write a function that takes a list as a parameter and returns a list of 
    just the positive numbers from the list.
    Call the function twice using the list [1, -2, -3, 4] and [18, 22, -3, 6]
    and print the result.
'''

'''
11. Write a function that takes a list of words and a letter as parameters, 
    if a word in the list has the letter in it, print the word out.
    Call the function using the list ['hello', 'people', 'cars', 'tables'] and letter 'e'
    and print the result.
'''

'''
12. Create a 2D list to represent this tic tac toe board where blanks are marked by '-'
     x |   | o
    -----------
       |   | x
    -----------
     x | o | o
    Print out the element in the top right corner of the board.
    Update the center element to an x and print out the updated board.
'''

'''
13. Challenge Question:
    Write a game of rock paper scissors where the user plays against the human in the terminal.
    Write several functions to complete this game:
        check_win(play1, play2) - this function compares play1 and play2 which should be strings
                                    'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' and returns 'player1', 'player2'
                                    or 'draw' based on who wins
        computer_play() - this function returns a randomly selected 'rock', 'pa
